This board is from Bigtreetech and went through various hardware revisions; all of them still feature a TFT pin header which is where you can tap the TX and RX needed. The wiring below is made with a 1.2 board, but the same applies for the other revisions as well; if you need the exact schematic for your mainboard version, you can check [Bigtreetech's github repository](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3/tree/master/hardware).

The TFT connector is labeled on the board; you can use dupont connectors for the wiring job, no soldering skills needed as long as your ESP comes with pre soldered headers. 
Note: the TFT connector provides 5V DC, so be sure to provide them on the correct ESP pin.
