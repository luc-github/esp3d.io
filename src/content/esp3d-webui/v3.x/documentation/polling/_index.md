WebUI support autoreporting but in case there is a need to get some information on demand, you can use polling commands. 

A polling command is a GCode command that will be sent to the printer and the response will be parsed and displayed in the WebUI each xxxxms.   

A refresh time of 3000ms is usally enough , shorter polling commands refreshtime may not be processed properly due to network latency.

Several polling commands for same refresh time can be added  at once separated added by `;` 

Note: A refresh time of 0 means polling will be done only once when webui start.

Here the list of polling commands available per firmware type:
