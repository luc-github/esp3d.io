## About Telnet

The ESP has a raw tcp server that can be used to execute commands. It called Telnet even it is not a real telnet protocol.
It behaves like serial port, you can send commands ending by `\n` and receive the response.

The raw tcp protocol does not support any authentication, but if authentication is enabled, you must use any ESPXXX command with appropriate password to authenticate the connection during the first connection. Other commands will be executed only after the authentication is done. You won't need to authenticate again for additional commands until you disconnect.

## Settings

Be sure `#define TELNET_FEATURE` is defined in configuration.h
