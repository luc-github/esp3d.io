## Generate template files

Use the script `npm run template` to generate up to date template files for all packs

!!! Note
    This is only necessary if you add new entries that are not yet in the template file.
    If not the case you can skip this step and generate a new [language pack](#generate-language-pack-files)

It will generate master file in `languages` directory : `master_translations.json` and split  used translations subdirectories : `cncgrblpack`, `cncgrblhalpack`, `printerpack`, `sandtablepack`

Currently:

-   CNC GRBL in `languages/cncgrblpack`
-   CNC grblHAL `languages/cncgrblhalpack`
-   3D Printers (all) `languages/printerpack`
-   Sand Table (all) `languages/sandtablepack`



## Generate language pack files

The list of currently supported languages is in `src/components/Translations/languages.json`, if new language is added, please add it to the list doing a PR or opening an issue.

| Language | Name | Code | file name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| French | Français | fr | lang-fr.json |
| German | Deutsch | de | lang-de.json |
| Hungarian | Magyar | hu | lang-hu.json |
| Indonesian | Bahasa Indonesia | id | lang-id.json |
| Italian | Italiano | it | lang-it.json |
| Spanish | Español | es | lang-es.json |
| Polish | Polski | pl | lang-pl.json |
| Russian | Русский | ru | lang-ru.json |
| Ukrainian | Українська | uk | lang-uk.json |
| Portuguese-Br | Português | ptbr | lang-ptbr.json |
| Turkish | Türkçe | tr | lang-tr.json |
| Thai | ไทย | th | lang-th.json |
| Korean | 한국어 | ko | lang-ko.json |
| Chinese (simplified) | 简体中文 | zhcn | lang-zhcn.json |
| Chinese (traditional) | 繁體中文 | zhtw | lang-zhtw.json |
| Japanese | 日本語 | ja | lang-ja.json |   

To generate a language pack file, you need to:

-  Use existing reference file, or if it is new language, rename a copy of the template file according the language code http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm removing `-` if any, and add `lang-` in from of name.
    so for example :

    -   for french language pack, `master_translations.json` file should be renamed to `lang-fr.json`
    -   for simplified chinese language pack, `master_translations.json` file should be renamed to `lang-zhcn.json`

-   Modify the language pack file according to the language you want to create or update 

-   Build the final packs using the following command to compress the final pack targeting the file :

    `npm run buildlangpack lang-<target language>.json`

    for example :   
    
    `npm run buildlangpack lang-fr.json`

    This will generate a non compressed and a compressed file in each subdirectory of `languageS` directory according to the systeme:

    - `languages/cncgrblpack/lang-fr.json`
    - `languages/cncgrblpack/lang-fr.json.gz`
    - `languages/cncgrblhalpack/lang-fr.json`
    - `languages/cncgrblhalpack/lang-fr.json.gz`
    - `languages/printerpack/lang-fr.json`
    - `languages/printerpack/lang-fr.json.gz`
    - `languages/sandtablepack/lang-fr.json`
    - `languages/sandtablepack/lang-fr.json.gz`

You can then use the compressed file in the WebUI or the non compressed file to test the language pack with the test server of WebUI 

## Compare template pack with language pack file

If you have a doubt about missing entries or extra entries, you can use the following script to compare current language pack content against the template language pack to see if the language pack need to be updated.

`npm run check reference=<template path file> target=<not compressed language pack>`

```
npm run check target=languages/printerpack/lang-fr.json reference=languages/printerpack/en.json

> ESP3D-WEBUI@3.0.0 check
> node ./config/checkpack.js "target=languages/printerpack/lang-fr.json" "reference=languages/printerpack/en.json"

Comparing files

Checking extra entries...
S724 : Fermer l'application
...done, found  1 extra entries

Checking missing entries...

S24 : Close
...done, found  2 missing entries

Comparaison done
```

## Propose / update language pack files

Please do a PR to webUI 3.0 github branch or submit ticket with at least the reference file, a complete PR include also generated compressed and clear version of the language pack files for each target using the script `npm run buildlangpack lang-<target language>.json`
