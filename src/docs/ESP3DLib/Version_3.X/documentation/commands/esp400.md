1 - key : `Settings`  
2 - value: array of data formated like this  
{"F":"network/network","P":"130","T":"S","V":"esp3d","H":"hostname","S":"32","M":"1"}  
or  
{"F":"service/notification","P":"1004","T":"B","V":"1","H":"auto notif","O":[{"no":"0"},{"yes":"1"}]}

    -   F: is filter formated as section/sub-section, if section is same as sub-section, it means no sub-section
    -   P: is id (also position reference so it is unique)
    -   T: is type of data which can be:
        -   S: for string
        -   I: for integer
        -   B: for Byte
        -   A: for IP address / Mask
        -   F: for float (only grblHAL)
        -   M: for bits mask (only grblHAL)
        -   X: for exclusive bitsfield (only grblHAL)
    -   V: is current value, if type is string and value is `********`, (8 stars) then it is a password
    -   E: is integer for exactess / precision of float/double value (only grblHAL)
    -   U: is text unit of value (only grblHAL)
    -   H: is text label of value
    -   S: is max size if type is string, and max possible value if value is number (byte, integer)
    -   M: is min size if type is string, and min possible value if value is number (byte, integer)
    -   MS: is additionnal min size if type is string (e.g for password can be 0 or 8, so need additional min size), M should be the more minimal value
        so MS value must be between M and S
    -   O: is an array of {label:value} used for possible values in selection or bits labels list
    -   R: need restart to be applied

Note: if Type `M` and `X` use `O` entry to define the label / position, if `O` is `[]` then axis label are used according need `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `A`, `B`, `C`  
Note2 : the 2.1 Flag type is no more used, several entries are used instead grouped by sub-section    

If no json the list is limited to a list of `<help>: <value>`
