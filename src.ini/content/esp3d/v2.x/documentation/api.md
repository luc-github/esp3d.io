if you call specific file, it will look for the filename and filename.gz (compressed)
if no file is defined and there is not index.html(.gz) it will display embedded page
another way to show the embedded page is /?forcefallback=yes


### /files (GET/POST)

    possible options/arguments are:   
- `quiet=yes` can be used when you don't want list files but just upload them    
- `path=...` define the path to the file    
- `action=...` define the action to execute which can be:  
        - `delete`   
            delete the file defined by `filename=...` it will also use `path=...` to do full path  
        - `deletedir`  
            delete the directory defined by `filename=...` it will also use `path=...` to do full path    
        - `createdir`

                "name":"index.html.gz", //the name of the file
                "size":"83.46 KB", //the formated size of the file 
                "time":"2022-09-04 11:56:05" //the time when the file was modified last time, this one is optional and depend on (FILESYSTEM_TIMESTAMP_FEATURE)
            },
            {
                "name":"subdir", //the name of the file / directory
                "size":"-1", //the size is -1 because it is a directory
                "time":"" //no time for directories optional as depend on (FILESYSTEM_TIMESTAMP_FEATURE)
            }
        ],
        "path":"/", //current path
        "occupation":"52", //% of occupation
        "status":"subdir created", //status 
        "total":"192.00 KB", //Formated total space of Filesystem
        "used":"100.00 KB" //Formated used space of Filesystem
    }
    ```

### /upload_serial (POST)
this handler is for uploading files to printer SD using M28/M29 protocol

### /command (GET)
this handler is for all commands the parameter is `cmd=...`

### /login (GET/POST)
this handler is for authentication function if enabled
    possible options/arguments are:

### Captive portal bypass handlers
to avoid a redirect to index.html and so a refresh of the page, some classic handler have been added so they all go to / handler actually
 - /generate_204
 - /gconnectivitycheck.gstatic.com
 - /fwlink/


## Web Socket 
**Only for WebUI not for bridge data**

use subprotocol `arduino` and web port +1 (e.g: 80+1=>81)

### <u>text mode</u>

Reserved
messages between webui / ESP
Format: `<label>:<message>`

-   from ESP to WebUI

    -   `CURRENT_ID:<id>`
        Sent when client is connecting, it is the last ID used and become the active ID

    -   `ACTIVE_ID:<id>`
        Broadcast current active ID, when new client is connecting, client without this is <id> should close, ESP WS Server close all open WS connections but this one also

    -   `ERROR:<code>:<message>`
        If an error raise when doing upload, it informs client it must stop uploading because sometimes the http answer is not possible,
        or cannot cancel the upload, this is a workaround as there is no API in current webserver to cancel active upload

    -   `DHT: <value>C`
        The DHT sensor connected to ESP like DHT22


### <u>binary mode</u>

Reserved

-   from ESP to WebUI
    serial stream data from ESP to WebUI

-   from WEBUI to ESP  
    [Not used]
